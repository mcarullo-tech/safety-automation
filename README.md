How does one measure the strength of an engineer? Some may refer to one's technical ability: highly proficient in engineering software programs such as CAD/CAM, 
skilled in many programming languages, and overall strong grasp of engineering fundamentals. Others may take a more holistic approach: considering the engineer's
ability to think critically about a problem, ask intelligent questions, and deliver solutions which send their clients into a mad frenzy of ecstasy.

My current company has adopted another approach: measuring the number of ROAM observations one submits. The ROAM observation is a web form which engineers are
highly encouraged to fill out at least once weekly. The engineer is to describe an unsafe incident they witnessed and record their mitigation strategy against it.

On the surface, it seems like a simple way to keep engineers proactive about their own safety. However, the reality is much more sinister. You see, the number of ROAM
observations one submits is directly related to the bonus one receives at the end of the fiscal year. If two candidates apply for the same promotion, all else being equal,
he who has submitted more ROAM observations will be selected. Even if the other candidate has stronger technical abilities, he who has submitted more ROAMS shall
be looked upon more favorably.

So you see, the ROAM observation is about more than safety. It is about POWER. It is a tool by which our corporate overlords can measure our obedience; to quantiy how 
willing we are to bend the knee to their will, regardless of what we see to be right and just. The ROAM observation is a vehicle by which the proletariat remains oppressed
by limiting his ability to exercise free-will and critical thinking.

While the outlook may look bleak, there is still a glimmer of hope. This tool has been created to fully automate the ROAM process. It has been created to help
the proletariate rise up against our corporate oppressors and take what is rightfully ours. It is much more than a simple automation tool.

It is a ticket to freedom.
